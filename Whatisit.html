     Cranial Fronto Nasal Dysplaysia is a genetic condition.
    It mainly affects the physical appearance of the head and face but can affect different parts on the body. 
    The skull is either fully or partially fused together before birth.
    The eyes tend to be widely spaced and there may be a bifid (split) nose.
     males with this condition may only have widely spaced eyes and no other symptom.

    There is a 25% chance that the child will have CFND. There is a 50% chance that the child will be a carrier.
