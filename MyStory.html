I thought I would explain a bit about my condition and how it affects my everyday life.
My mum had a normal pregnancy but she had a feeling something was wrong.
When I was born I already had a number of health concerns, some more severe than other. 
These included: my skull being fused, my eyes being closer to my ears than to each other, having an extra big toe on my left foot, extra bones in my shoulders and my tongue being tied.
I am also extremely flat footed and have had problems with my feet since birth.
 <br>
 <br>
My first operation was conducted when I was 9 months and was to done to relive pressure on my brain and give it space to grow properly. To do this the surgeon, Mr Hyde, had to make in incision across the top of my head, from ear to ear, to allow him access to my skull.
Mr Hyde then used metal plates to hold my skull in the correct place and used 42 staples to close the incision. During this procedure my heart stopped. My parents never left the hospital during any of my future operations because of this.

My second operation was a much simpler one and was to release my tongue tie
<br>My third operation being to remove my extra toe. I was finally able to wear whatever shoes I wanted
My mum told me it looked like a love heart, I wish I had a picture.
 <br>
 <br>
 My fourth operation was the biggest, and most complex, of them all and also the one that gave my parents the hardest decision of their life. This operation was not a necessity however it had become very clear that society did not accept me the way I looked. I had gone through over 7 years of people staring and making comments and my parents wanted nothing more than for me to be accepted. 
<br><br>
Mr Koppel, my new surgeon, explained to my parents that he could perform an operation that would drastically change the shape of my face, making it look a lot more natural. However, this came with huge risks. There was a 10% chance of fatality.
<br>
As I said before, my parents only wanted the best for me and made the decision to go through with the 9 hours operation
<br>
Using the scar from my first operation Mr Koppel, along with a team of specialist, started the operation. They used wires to pull my eyes closer together and attempted to create a natural bridge for my nose. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the operation, the surgeons quickly ran into trouble.
13 hours later and the operation was finally over. I was immediately placed into the Intensive Care Unit where, to everyoneâ€™s surprise, I was well enough to be moved onto the ward in only 12 hours.
<br>
My biggest memory from this was being very upset when I was told that Mr Koppel would have to shave my head prior to the operation. When Mr Koppel saw how upset it made me he agreed to shave it off once I was under the effects of the general anaesthetic. 
Due to this operation I missed most of primary 3, luckily I lived in a very small town and my teachers could come to my house and give me lessons!
<br>
 <br>
My fifth operation was to be done in an effort to re-align my jaw as one side was growing quicker than the other. 
This was done by Mr Koppel shaving the bone of my jaw and I remember this being the most painful recovery of any of my operations.
