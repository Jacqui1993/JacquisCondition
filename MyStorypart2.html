    My sixth operation was to form a bridge in my nose. Mr Koppel did this by taking a section of my rib out and making that the bridge to my nose
    I asked him to pierce my ears while I was under general as it was so sore and could only get one done at the tattoo shop!
    <br><br>
     My seventh operation was to remove a bunion I had from my left foot. This was the easiet one out them all.  
     <br><br>
     My eighth operation was to re-align my jaw again. About a year before this surgery I had to get braces.
     I absolutely hated them. This surgery was done by Mr Koppel and Mr Gardener (orthodontest)
    the worst part was when the dentist was tightening my brace and slipped putting her hand and pliers into my mouth!
    Mr Koppel and mr Gardener had made my bite even worse so they could correct it properly in surgery.
    To do this surgery Mr Koppel had to break my jaw and reset it using plates/wires and screws.
    He managed to do everything in my mouth so I had no scars on my face/head. Mr Gardener decided to put elastic bands around my braces.
    this was horrible. I really struggled after this operation as my bite had totally changed so I didnt know where my mouth was!
    I was on a soft diet for weeks - this was the worst as I love food! 
     I had my braces in for a further year and a half. I was so happy when they came off!

    My ninth operation and hopefully last! was to fuse my big toe joint on my left foot as it had arthritis
    and it was causing my toes to bend the wrong way and lots of pain.
    <br><br>
    <p2>After 23 years I was finally discharged from Mr Koppel's care, forever grateful for his work.</p2>
