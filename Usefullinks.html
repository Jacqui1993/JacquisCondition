       Before I go I thought I would share some stories about when I was getting filmed for Tonight! with Trevor McDonald.
       I loved getting filmed, my broadcaster was Vanessa Collingridge i loved her! I liked the soundman so much i named one of my teddies after him - Angus!
       The tv crew were with us for 6 weeks, before my big operation and a few weeks after.
       <br>They actually filmed the whole operation - I've yet to see it, it would be strange watching your face being pulled down to your chin, wouldn't it?
      <br>
       Because I was on TV I recieved alot of letters, Thankfully I lived in a very small town as some of the letters were addressed "to the sunshine girl".
